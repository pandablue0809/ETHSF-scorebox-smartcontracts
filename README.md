# Smart contracts

This repo contains 2 smart contracts written in Rust and Solidity, respectively to store and query credit scores on either NEAR Protocol testnet or Polygon Mumbai testnet. Although the 2 contracts are written in different programming languages and are deployed on different blockchains their logic is almost identical.
